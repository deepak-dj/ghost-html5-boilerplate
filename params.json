{"name":"Ghost-HTML5-Boilerplate","tagline":"A barebones theme for Ghost based on HTML5-Boilerplate.","body":"# Ghost HTML5 Boilerplate Theme\r\n\r\nA barebones theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) based on [html5-boilerplate](http://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/). This theme offers a very basic, unstyled output of your Ghost content to give you a head-start with the theme engine, while implementing the structure and best-practices of HTML5-Boilerplate. The theme also borrows some code from the default Ghost theme [Casper](http://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).\r\n\r\nPlease note that Ghost is in an early development stage and this theme may adapt as Ghost evolves.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/wiki/jdahdah/ghost-html5-boilerplate/ghost-html5-boilerplate-screencap.png)\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\nDownload the [latest version](http://github.com/jdahdah/ghost-html5-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) of the Ghost HTML5-Boilerplate Theme and unzip its contents into a folder named whatever you want to call your theme. Put that in the Ghost theme directory:\r\n\r\n`[GHOST_DIRECTORY]/content/themes/`\r\n\r\nRestart Ghost, then navigate to `Settings` \\> `General` in the Ghost admin area. Select your theme from the dropdown menu labeled \"Theme\" and hit `Save`. Voilà.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\nCurrently based on html5-boilerplate v4.3.0.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\nPlease leave feedback by opening an [issue](http://github.com/jdahdah/ghost-html5-boilerplate/issues) on Github.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\nIt’s currently not possible in Ghost to implement a CDN for jQuery delivery in the same way it is done in h5bp. The reason is that the system outputs jQuery in the custom tag `{{ghost_foot}}` which must be included in every theme. This is a [known issue](http://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/1181) that may be resolved in a later version of Ghost.\r\n\r\n## Copyright & License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Jerome Dahdah - Released under the MIT License.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
